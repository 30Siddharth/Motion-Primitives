The Simulator was developed by the faculty, Dr. James Paulos and TA's of MEAM 620 (Advanced Robotics at UPenn, Sprin 2020).

Things we need not change:
1. SE(3) controller. Might have to tune.
2. Occupancy map 

New things we need:
1. Trajectrcory generator that includes forward simulation
2. Graph generator which includes the search and final path
3. New Sandbox.py that uses these to show us the final path
