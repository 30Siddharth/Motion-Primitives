Last Done:
1. Fixed the quintic trajectory generator

Observations;
1. The Speed matters. Works best for 3 m/s 
2. The controller need to be tuned, especially for the damping. We can sacrifice rise time for now. It fails to stop and overshoots which causes collisions.
3. The waypoints cannot be close.
4. The trajectory is smooth and pretty similar to the cubic spline.

To Do:
1. Fix the controller
2. Identify reason of why it needs higher Speed
3. Write code for collision detection
4. Identify other ways to get sparse path
5. Make different files for quintic and cubic
6. Try the optimisation method
